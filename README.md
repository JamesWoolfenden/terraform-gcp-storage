# terraform-gcp-storage [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/JamesWoolfenden/terraform-gcp-storage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/JamesWoolfenden/terraform-gcp-storage) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/JamesWoolfenden/terraform-gcp-storage.svg)](https://github.com/JamesWoolfenden/terraform-gcp-storage/releases/latest)

Creates a GCP storage account.
I created this  module intially to help with making a helm repo.

I had to first create a test repo from the charts folder

```cli
helm serve --repo-path ./charts
```

This gave me a sample index.yaml, which I added as part of the repo creation process [its in the template fodler for the example].

I now have a public helm repo.
https://helm-repo-examplea.storage.googleapis.com/

This has a mininal **index.yaml**

## Adding the repo to your Helm

```cli
helm repo add baby-steps https://helm-repo-examplea.storage.googleapis.com/
"baby-steps" has been added to your repositories
```

Verify:

```cli
$helm repo list
NAME            URL
stable          https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com
baby-steps      https://helm-repo-examplea.storage.googleapis.com/
```

## Usage

Add **module.storage.tf** to your code:-

```terraform
module "storage" {
  source  = "../../"
  binding     = var.binding
  bucket_name = var.bucket_name
  project     = var.project
  location    = var.location
}
```

## Permissions

I got this error when I was making this project, your service acccount will need the permissions, I added Cloud Storage Admin.

```error
 examplea@examplea.iam.gserviceaccount.com does not have storage.buckets.create access to project XXXXXX, forbidden
```
