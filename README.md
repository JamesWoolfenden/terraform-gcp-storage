This creates a GCP storage account.

I created this module initially to help with making a Helm repo.

I had to first create a test repo from the charts folder

```cli
helm serve --repo-path ./charts
```

This gave me a sample **index.yaml**, which I added as part of the repo creation process [it's in the template folder for the example].

I now have a public Helm repo.
https://helm-repo-examplea.storage.googleapis.com/

This example has a minimal **index.yaml**

## Adding the repo to your Helm

```cli
helm repo add baby-steps https://helm-repo-examplea.storage.googleapis.com/
"baby-steps" has been added to your repositories
```

Verify:

```cli
$helm repo list
NAME            URL
stable          https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com
baby-steps      https://helm-repo-examplea.storage.googleapis.com/
```

## Usage

Add **module.storage.tf** to your code:-

```terraform
module "storage" {
  source        = "JamesWoolfenden/storage/gcp"
  version       = "0.2.3"
  common_tags   = var.common_tags
  binding       = var.binding
  bucket_name   = var.bucket_name
  project       = var.project
  location      = var.location
  log_bucket    = google_storage_bucket.logging.name
  force_destroy = true
}
```

## Permissions

This being GCP you'll get this error when was making this project, your service account will need these permissions, Included in the "Cloud Storage Admin" role.

```error
 examplea@examplea.iam.gserviceaccount.com does not have storage.buckets.create access to project XXXXXX, forbidden
```
